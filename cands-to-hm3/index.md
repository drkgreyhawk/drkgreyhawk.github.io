title: C&S to HM3 Tool
---

My first Elm project, a simple app that converts a Chivalry & Sorcery character to Harnmaster 3 rules. This was a very old app I made in college with JavaScript. I decided to teach myself Elm with the help of [XetiCode](https://xeticode.com) by re-writing my JavaScript into Elm. I like keeping this around as a reminder of where I started and how far I've come.
